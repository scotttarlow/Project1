Data Science Immersive | Project 1	 						

Your project will be assessed using the following standards, [derived from the data science workflow](../../../../resources/syllabus/DSI-workflow-v1.pdf):

- [ ] Identify problem
- [ ] Acquire Data
- [ ] Parse Data
- [ ] Mine Data
- [ ] Refine Data
- [ ] Present Results

Acceptable performance for these standards is based on how well you've performed the specific requirements listed below.

### Performance Evaluation
> Instructors: Mark boxes with 'X' or "n/a" if a section does not apply. Note that "Exceeds Expectations" (3pts) is really only applicable for student writeups or specially marked "*Bonus*" Options.

| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) | Exceeds Expectations (3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Identify: Discuss Data | | | | X|
| Acquire: Load Data with Python | | | X| n/a  |
| Parse: Print Data | | | X| n/a |
| Mine: Sort Data | | | X| n/a |
| Refine: Analyze Data | | |X | n/a |
| Present: Visualize Data *Bonus: Use Tableau*  | | | | X |
| *Bonus! Present: Create blog post summary* | | | | |

## - Notes:
* You probably knew this but for no. 12, you can also use the min() and max() functions on lists.
* For no. 18, in the future you can use scipy.stats.normaltest(your_feature) to do a hypothesis test for normality.

## Score:
Based on the requirements, you can earn a maximum of  **14**  points on this project. Your score is: **14**

- Remember, your total score is helpful as a gauge of how well you met the project requirements, but use the individual standards and instructor feedback to help iterate and improve on your projects!
